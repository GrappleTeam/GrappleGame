# GitGrappleGame  
------  
  
Grapple is a platformer/shooter game written with a homemade 2d engine. It is written in Java, with the intent of getting it workable on Windows, OSx and Linux, as well as the Ouya game system. To accomplish this, we will have 3 different releases:

*   Alpha: Starting functionality on desktop systems
*   Beta: Full functionality on desktop systems and porting to the Ouya
*   Final: Monetization of the game

In order to start working on the game, follow these instructions:

1.  Install git, so you will be able to clone the current files
2.  Navigate to the directory you want the files to be stored in with the command "cd"
3.  Use the following command to download the code: "git clone https://github.com/GrappleTeam/GrappleGame.git"
4.  Edit the code using your favorite text editor  

To make the program run, wrap the whole program as an executable jar file. It can then be run in the terminal.
